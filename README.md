Healthcare Service Analytics: Emergency Room Performance Dashboard
An interactive Power BI dashboard built to uncover real-time and historical trends in emergency room patient flow, demographics, and departmental load—empowering hospital leaders with actionable healthcare intelligence.

🎯 Short Description / Purpose
The PulsePoint ER Dashboard is designed to analyze patterns in emergency room operations over a 19-month period. It enables hospital administrators to monitor patient demographics, wait time efficiency, referral trends, and satisfaction levels, allowing data-driven improvements in service delivery and staffing.

🧰 Tech Stack
The dashboard was developed using the following tools and technologies:

📊 Power BI Desktop – Core platform for building visuals and user navigation.

🧹 Power Query – Used for data loading, cleansing, and reshaping.

📐 DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) – For dynamic KPIs, time intelligence, and calculated columns.

🔗 Data Modeling – Established relationships between patient, referral, and doctor datasets to allow slicing and drilling across views.

📁 File Format – .pbix for development; .png for dashboard snapshots.

🗂️ Data Source
Origin: Synthetic dataset simulating hospital ER data

Scope: 9,124 unique patients from April 2023 to October 2024

Fields Include:

Patient ID, Gender, Age

Admission Date & Status

Wait Time

Race

Referred Department

Satisfaction Score

⭐ Features / Highlights
• Business Problem
Hospitals often lack a centralized, visual way to assess emergency room bottlenecks, admission patterns, or patient satisfaction trends. Without such insights, it becomes difficult to balance staffing, minimize wait times, and identify underserved patient segments.

• Goal of the Dashboard
To provide hospital decision-makers with a single-view interactive tool that:

Tracks patient flow trends over time

Pinpoints operational inefficiencies

Enhances strategic planning for staffing, referral management, and patient satisfaction

• Walkthrough of Key Visuals
